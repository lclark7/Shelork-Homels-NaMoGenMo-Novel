# Shelork-Homels-NaMoGenMo-Novel
This is a repository for my novel I created for NaMoGenMo.

For this project, I wanted to take the Gutenberg version of Sherlock Holmes and run it through a script in Python that completely randomizes and rewrites the text. I created a script in Google Colaboratory using ngrams to randomize the word assortment. I used WeasleyPrint and Markdown to convert it to HTML so I could edit it using CSS, which I then used to generate a PDF of the final randomized docuement, which I called "Shelork Homels." Basically, I wanted it to generate a 50,000 word novel that, at a glance, looked legiable but really was not. The example I provided in this repository has a total of 52,484 words. It is 122 pages long and has its own title page with page numbers. 

All of the code I used came from various examples provided to my Creative Coding class at the University of Mary Washingotn. Our professor, Zach Whalen, was a great help in providing various examples and helping us expand upon any ideas we might have had.
